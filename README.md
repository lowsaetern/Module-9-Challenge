# Module-9-Challenge

This week we were tasked with creating application that generates a README from the command line. Using Javascript and Node.js we were able input user information to create a markdown file.

To invoke this application from the command line, you must input index.js and you will be prompted to ask questions about your project to create a README.

After the information is inputted and a README file is created, you will then be able to click on the links of the Table of Contents to bring you to the corresponding section of your choice.

Below I have inserted a screenshot of the generated README file as well as a video link to demonstrate how the applcation is invoked and used.
